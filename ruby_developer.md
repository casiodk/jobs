### Technical stuff

The application is written in Ruby, mainly backed by Rails. Both the application
and the database is hosted as a service, so there will not be much dev-ops work.

The application is brand new, so you will have a lot of influence on the architecture.

You should have experience with:

 - Ruby
 - Ruby on Rails or another MVC framework


It would be an advantage if you also have experience with:

 - Writing APIs
 - Test Driven Development
 - MongoDB
 - Amazon Web Services
 - Angular, Backbone, Ember or similar
 - Git


You will be working in a small and casual development team, where only some
people are located in the Copenhagen office. Therefore you must be able to work
independable.

*We work hard and have fun!*
