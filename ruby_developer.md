### Stuff
Preadly is a small Danish startup, located right in the central heart of Copenhagen, the beautiful capital of Denmark. We’re a bunch of awesome guys, who’s developing a very awesome application. We will reinvent the way readers and bloggers interact with each other. But that is just the top of the iceberg, furthermore we want to minimize the time spent daily on searching for great posts on subjects, and find blogs that match your interests. We love to use the latest technology, so we spend a lot of time trying to learn these new technologies. We need a developer to help us build this kick-ass application, and more importantly help us doing it faster! You should be very “startup-friendly” and love working with codes, you are kind of a perfectionist and trying to solve every problem the best way possible. 

### Technical stuff

The application is written in Ruby, mainly backed by Rails. Both the application
and the database is hosted as a service, so there will not be much dev-ops work.

The application is brand new, so you will have a lot of influence on the architecture.

You should have experience with:

 - Ruby
 - Ruby on Rails or another MVC framework


It would be an advantage if you also have experience with:

 - Writing APIs
 - Test Driven Development
 - MongoDB
 - Amazon Web Services
 - Angular, Backbone, Ember or similar
 - Git


You will be working in a small and casual development team, where only some
people are located in the Copenhagen office. Therefore you must be able to work
independable.

*We work hard and have fun!*
